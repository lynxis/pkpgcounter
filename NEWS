pkpgcounter News :

  * 3.30 :
  
    - Added a minimal parser for Hewlett-Packard LIDIL documents, as 
      produced by the hpijs driver.
      
  * 3.20 :
   
    - Added a minimal parser for Brother HBP documents.
    
    - Added support for Canon ImageRunner commands to the PCLXL parser,
      much like it was already done for the PCL3/4/5 parser.
      
  * 3.10 :
  
    - Added a minimal parser for ESC/PAGES03 style documents.
    
    - Fixed another problem in the code handling the output of Canon's
      ImageRunner printer drivers.
    
  * 3.00 :
  
    - Fixed a problem in the code handling the output of Canon's ImageRunner
      printer drivers.
      
    - Licensing terms changed to GNU GPL v3.0 or higher.  
    
  * 2.18 :
  
    - Fixed an incompatibility with Python v2.5
    
  * 2.17 : 
  
    - Fixed problems in the handling of PJL number of copies (COPIES= and QTY=)
      which caused the number of copies for each page to be squared.
    
  * 2.16 : 
  
    - Fixed a problem in the PCL3/4/5 parser to accomodate line based
      report generators which expect the printer to skip to next page
      based on lines per page instead of sending a specific command.
      
  * 2.15 :
   
    - Fixed a regexp in the PDF parser which caused some files to be
      incorrectly accounted for.
    
    - Improved the detection of the number of copies in PostScript documents.

      comments.
      
  * 2.13 : 
   
    - Nowrecognizes the GC colorspace if you only want to differentiate
      grayscale pages from coloured pages. In this colorspace, the
      percents are always "G : 100.0   C : 0.0" or "G : 0.0   C : 100.0"
      respectively for a grayscale page and a coloured page.
  
  * 2.12 :
  
    - Fixed a problem with the PostScript parser.
    
  * 2.11 :
  
    - Improved overall robustness in ink accounting mode.

    - Added a plain text parser, with support for both page counting and
      ink coverage.

    - Improved the PostScript parser.
    
  * 1.85 :
  
    - Added support for Samsung QPDL (aka SPL2) file format in page
      counting mode, thanks to the work done by Aurélien Croc on
      reverse engineering the file format.
      
  * 1.85alpha :
  
    - Added test document and program to generate the test document
      to check the functionning of the ink coverage computation algorithm.

  * 1.84alpha :
  
    - Added initial support for the computation of ink coverage.
      See python analyzer.py --help for details. The same command

      documented yet.
