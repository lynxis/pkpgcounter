====================================================================

This directory contains a gzipped PostScript file, master.ps.gz, 
obtained by printing to a file a part of the SlashDot.org website 
from the Galeon web browser on July 2nd 2004. 

When uncompressed, this 16 pages file can be used to test the 
accuracy of the generic Page Description Language analyzer included 
in pkpgcounter for different conversion outputs of gs. 

To see if it works, simply launch :

        $ ./runtests.sh
        
It should report 16 pages for each document. If it doesn't then 
there's a bug in the generic Page Description Language analyzer. 
Please report this to : alet@librelogiciel.com

This script will also launch the test for the computation of
ink coverage. Look at the file colors.pdf to see what the 
results should look like.
